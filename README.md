# ðŸŽ¶ Voice Type Classification in Choirs (ANN vs CNN)

This project focuses on classifying individual **choirs voice types** â€” Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass, using **acoustic analysis features** extracted from vocal recordings.  
Two deep learning models, **ANN** and **CNN**, are compared in terms of performance and accuracy.

Developed as part of my **Research Methodology** project(Semester 4) at Binus University.

## Objectives
- To analyze how **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** perform in classifying choral voice types.
- To identify which model produces higher accuracy.
- To apply acoustic feature extraction for real world music and vocal analysis.

## Dataset
Dataset from **Zenodo** :
- [Choral Singing Dataset (Zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/records/2649950)

The dataset contains labeled choral voice samples (SATB) for supervised learning.
